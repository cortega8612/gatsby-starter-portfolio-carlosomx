Hi there!
Carlos here, a UX/UI designer making the switch to a Product Owner role.

I love the opportunity to more directly affect a product's success. With my ten years of experience in the design field. I have realized the importance or creating amazing, data-driven, user-centered solutions.

I've worked on a variety of projects, from small startups to large enterprises, and I've always enjoyed the challenge of understanding user needs and translating them into intuitive and engaging experiences.
In addition, my background as an industrial designer and entrepreneur has helped me to collaborate with people that have different needs and aspirations. Allowing me to empathize and communicate clearly with different end-users or stakeholders.

I enjoy reading and learning about digital products, AI, design, cloud computing, robotic process automation, and data & business analysis during my free time.
Occasionally, I do photography  and glassblowing .
